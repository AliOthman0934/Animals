### With regard to the three follwing qustions that i shoud think about:
- Why do you think we develop features in a branch rather than straight away pushed to main? Is there a situation that pushing to the main branch directly is better?
   By working in a separate branch, developers can make changes without affecting the stability of the main branch and also When multiple developers are working on the same project, using feature branches allows them to work on different parts of the codebase concurrently.

  
- What would happen if you create two different branches that edit the same file and then merge them after each other?
 the version control system (Git) will attempt to combine the changes made in both branches and see if there is any conflict.

- Why do you think is the commit message important?
  when multiple developers may work on the same project. A well-written commit message helps team members to understand the purpose of a change.
